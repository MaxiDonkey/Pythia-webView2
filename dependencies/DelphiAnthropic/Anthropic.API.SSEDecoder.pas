(*

  Purpose
  -------
  TSSEDecoder provides incremental parsing of Server-Sent Events (SSE) streams
  (RFC 8895 framing rules in practice) with special care for streaming UTF-8.

  Key Points
  ----------
  • Chunk boundaries are not aligned with UTF-8 character boundaries.
    The decoder therefore buffers bytes in FPending and only decodes the largest
    safe prefix determined by Utf8SafeCut, keeping any trailing incomplete UTF-8
    sequence for the next Feed call.

  • Chunk boundaries are not aligned with SSE event boundaries.
    The decoder buffers decoded text in FTextBuffer, extracts complete lines
    separated by LF, normalizes CRLF, and processes one line at a time.

  SSE Subset Implemented
  ----------------------
  • Only "data:" fields are handled.
  • Multiple "data:" lines are concatenated with LF (#10) as specified by SSE.
  • An empty line terminates an event and triggers emission via FOnEvent.
  • Other fields ("event:", "id:", "retry:") and comments are ignored.

  Expected Payload
  ----------------
  The consumer callback (TSSEOnEvent) receives the concatenated "data:" payload
  as a single string. Higher-level code is responsible for interpreting the
  payload (e.g., JSON objects, "[DONE]" markers, etc.).

  Threading
  ---------
  TSSEDecoder is not internally synchronized. Feed/Flush must be called from a
  single execution context or externally protected if used concurrently.

  Limitations / Non-Goals
  -----------------------
  • Utf8SafeCut prevents cutting the final code point but does not fully validate
    the entire buffer as UTF-8.
  • The decoder does not implement reconnection logic, last-event-id handling,
    retry semantics, or event name dispatching.

  Usage Pattern
  -------------
  • Call Feed for each incoming byte chunk.
  • Call Flush once when the stream ends to process any remaining buffered data.
